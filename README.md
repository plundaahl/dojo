# Dojo: Minecraft Action Framework

A Minecraft command code framework for creating complex NPCs and player abilities.

## Project Status

ARCHIVED. Really, you should do this sort of thing using mods. This is kept here mostly for posterity.

## What Is This, Really?

Originally, I was trying to build a light recreation of the Dark Souls combat system in Minecraft, using nothing but command block code (yes, I'm aware that's crazy). While I don't have the time or inclination to work on that anymore, I'm still pretty proud of it. Some things I built with it include:

- Trigger custom actions when jumping, falling, tapping crouch.
- Control NPC movement, including forcing specific directions.
- Complex, sequenced NPC attack animations, with multiple steps and the ability to animation cancel.

The primary mechanisms used are Minecraft scoreboards, invisible armor stands, potion effects, manipulating entity tags, and big tree of functions that run every tick.
